- Still no revenue!
- Did more targeted ads with big brands
- Zynga came onto the scene and stole the #1 spot
  - They also had paying customers
  - LS had 80 million users, but no scalable business model
- Pivoted and spent a week building the social commerce app
  - Needed to out-execute and out-innovate
  - Fastest user/revenue growth in the space
  - Gained 2-3% market share each month for 18 months

## Technology
- Consumer only sees 10% (iceberg analogy)
- Built a lot of internal tools for various needs
- Custom iPad apps for field sales teams
  - What works, doesn't, contracts, e-sigs, intel, etc.
- Not just about e-mails - localizing eCommerce
  - Building bigger businesses for lots of local companies

## LivingSocial Escapes - "weekend-in-a-box"
- largest flash travel site on the web within a week

- Strategic deals
  - Amazon deal - 1.2 million sold, 6% of all eCommerce for that day (according to Goldman)
  
## LivingSocial Adventures
- LS operated events
- Build a culture around the brand and events

## LivingSocial Instant
- Realtime and location based
- First to market
- Can retailers fight for your business

## "Execution matters, ideas don't" - Fred Wilson
- Which social network was first?  WHo cares?
- Culture matters
- In tech teams, less of the right people can actually accomplish more
- For a long time, LS tech team was only ~10 people

## Know your metrics
- Dave McClure's theory
- Acquisitions
- Activation
- Retention
- Referral
- Revenue

## Be nervous (or you aren't trying hard enough)
- Will be making tough decisions
- LS went from 6 month to a 5 week runway when they were building the initial product

## Build your toolbox
- Experience scaling, architecting, etc.
- Take what you know and iterate

## JSIO
- Just shit it out
- Don't talk build, what matters is having users trying it out and giving feedback

## Don't ever be satiated
- There's always something next (and bigger) for you to achieve
