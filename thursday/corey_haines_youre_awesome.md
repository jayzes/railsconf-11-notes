# Corey Haines - How to get the most out of a conference

- Forgot to send the title so got scheduled on the wrong day
- New title: "I'm awesome"
- Actually, "You're awesome"
- Devs, presenters, etc.

## How to be awesome?
- You have to practice!
  - Speaking - friends, mailing list, blogs, confs, user groups, etc.
  - Coding - get the fundamentals - test-first, automated testing, TDD, 4 rules of simple design
  - Find events (coderetreats, code dojos)
  - Share code (github) - get feedback!
  - Our community is a meritocracy
    - You don't have to be a prolific coder
    - Based purely on sharing
- Get out there and do something!
