# Dan Melton - Code for America
## What is CFA?
  - Generating a big-ass geek army
  - All walks, all skills
  - Pair up with governments
  - Open up databases, etc.
  - Ask "What would you do differently?"
  - Put geeks in government (fellowship)
  - Give them a year to build really interesting, open source applications
  - Got 360 apps for 20 fellowship spots
  - Got 13 city apps for 4 spots
  - Brought participants to SF for bootcamp, then sent them out to cities

## Example - @sferik
- Wanted to take a break from the startup world and give back
- Able to spend time on own open source projects as well
- Fills a need for coders to actually be able to leverage their skill sets to give back
- Give a modest stipend and get health benefits for the duration of the fellowshi

## Break down barriers between government and citizens
- Bring agility and cost savings to gov'ts
- Applications are due in August
- Program starts in January
- Austin will be one city - not sure of others yet

## CFA Tools
- Rails community
  - Is fanatical about building and sharing high quality tools
  - Tends to be social but not political
  - Probably gets news from Colbert and Stewart
- Daily Show has been reporting a lot on the use of new media tools for interesting social purposes
  - Think Egypt, Tunisia, etc. 
  - Built by engineers, not just for engineers anymore
  - Ex. tea party is largely organized via Meetup (630 groups, 90K members, 100s of cities)
  - Ruby community is using meetup as well
    - Get together as pissed off people working to make things better
    - More similar than you might think, but with wildly different outcomes
    - Both have kooky leaders (Palin, DHH, Aaron P.)
      - Ours are brilliant, passionate and interesting
    - They generate lots of buzz and legislation, we generate lots of projects and code
    - At the end of the day, they took a political route and we took a toolbuilding route
    - What happens when the toolbuilders start using their tools to advocate change and take charge?

## How can we use our own tools, values, etc. to make a difference?
- Geek army
- Think bigger than just the tools
- Make change in your community
- Think US Army Corps of Engineers
