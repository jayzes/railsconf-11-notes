# Jonathan Julian - Enough Design to be Dangerous

## A Story
- Work for a startup
- Designer's contract expired
- Didn't have a designer on staff
- Had to make do
- Started thinking about points for developers that were interesting and maybe non-intuitive
- Presented a talk at BMore on Rails and BMore JS Meetup
- Looking for more input

## Learning to be dangerous
- Developers are really smart, and can definitely learn this stuff
- Many of the same principles around beautiful code and cleanliness apply to design as well
- Not going to talk about Sass or Coffeescript
- Fundamentals of Design (IANAD - not from a book)
  - Space
    - Every element takes up space
    - Think of things in blocks (nested)
  - Proximity
    - Things that are related to each other should be near each other
    - Grids (960, Compass, Blueprint) - forces designers to put things in places that make sense
      - Get a sense of scale and unity that pulls the design together
      - May choose to throw the actual grid CSS away
  - Color
    - Least favorite part of the talk
    - Color theory?
    - Color wheel - pick colors that are equidistant or adjacent to ensure that they're complementary
    - Resources
      - Kuler.adobe.com
      - colorschemer.com
  - Typography
    - Serif/Sans-Serif/Modern/Slab-Serif/Script
    - Psychology similar to colors
    - Serif fonts - looks like a newspaper, reads easily, not fun
    - Scripts usually avoided on the web
    - Readability vs. legibility
      - Easy to read vs. easy to recognize
    - Constrast is a huge thing in making excitement - if they look the same they're boring
    - Watch out for widows and orphans

## Let's get dangerous
- Use a grid
- Trick:  outline 1px dotted #00f for all block elements to see element overlap
- Add more margin to everything - give your page room to breathe and adjust from there
- Center or left-aligned?  Pick one and stick with it
- Biz card example - constrast in color and adjustment in line height to convey proximity
- Style all form elements - book by Luke W on form elements (lukew.com)
- Use unique fonts (Google Webfonts)
- Repeat elements (triangles, highlights, etc)
- Greys are easy for even contrast (#333, #666, #999, #CCC)
- Avoid #000 and #FFF
- Text shadows and box shadows
- Gradients - now super easy.  Think about the light source (lit from above)

## An Example
- More padding on left/right on buttons than on top/bottom
- Subtle hover states are nice to give feedback

## Get Inspired
- Design is all around
- Signs, storefront windows, flyers, etc.
- Notice the good and the bad and figure out why

## Books
- The Non-Designer's Design Book
- Graphic Design for Non-Designers
- Both print-focused but still relevant
