# Eric Ries - Why Rails Makes Startups

Lean Startup book coming out - http://lean.st/ - site by pivotal

- Great startup movies - social network and ghostbusters
- Play in 3 acts - setup, photo montage, how to divide the spoils
- The photo montage act is what makes or breaks it...but it's too boring for the movie

## Lean Startup Principles:

### Entrepreneurs are everywhere
What is a startup?
- A human institution designed to deliver a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty 
- Nothing to do with size, sector, or industry
- An experiment!
  - Not a question of can it be built, but should it be built?  Can it be sustained?
  - We can build anything we can imagine at this point
  - But we are wasting people's time on an industrial scale!
- STOP WASTING PEOPLE'S TIME
- Most startups fail
  - Why are we building things that fail?  It's not rocket science
  - Why build things that nobody wants
- Who to blame - Frederick Winslow Taylor
  - Father of scientific management
  - Study work to find the best way
  - Standardize work into tasks
  - Compensate workers based on performance
  - We're living in the pre-scientific age of entrepreneurship!
  
### Entrepreneurship is management
- Key to this is the pivot!
- What do successfuly startups have in common?  MS, PayPal, Flickr
- CHange directions but stay grounded in what we've learned
- Successful and unsuccessful entrepreneurs are equally crazy - it's all about how they deal with problems
- If we can reduce the time between pivots, we can increase our odds of success before we run out of money

### Validated Learning
- Traditional product development is the waterfall
  - Unit of progress - advance to the next stage
  - Allows us to achieve failure
  - On time and on budget mean nothing for a failed project
  - Only make sense if you have a stable operating history
- Agile product development
  - Unit of progress - line of working code
  - Use a product owner or in-house customer
  - Problem is know, solution is unknown
  - IMVU - IM-based avatar social network
    - Crappy, crappy first version
    - Embarrassed to ship it
    - Pivoted away from IM and threw away thousands of lines of Eric's code
    - Why did it take 6 months to figure out that customers didn't care about IM?
    - 6 months of work could have the same value as a 3-hour dummy page to gauge interest

### Build-Measure-Learn
- Feedback loop - catalyst that turns ideas into cod
- Scalability, coding fun, team size, etc. don't matter
- It's about how flexible the product is for our ability to learn from customers - what's working and what is not
- Embrace the process of learning and reacting as fast as possible - this is what Rails excels at
- Contradictory feedback is tough to deal with, but you only get a gold star for results
- Lean startup is a set of disciplined methods to avoid running into these issues
- Build products with an immune system so we can clear out our fear and act faster

### Innovation Accounting
3 learning milestones
1.  Establish the Baseline
  - Build the minimum viable product
  - Measure how customers behave right now
2.  Tune the Engine
  - experiment to try to improve metrics from baseline to ideal
3.  Pivot or Persevere

- If experiments reach diminishing returns, it's time to pivot
  
## Q&A
- If we did chemistry like we do entrepreneurship, most labs would explode
- An entrepreneur is a person who does whatever it takes to be successful
